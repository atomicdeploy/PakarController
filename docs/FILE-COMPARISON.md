# PakarController donor comparison

Whole-repository superiority is **not established**. This report exposes retained code, scoped improvements, omissions and gaps; it does not turn missing reviews into exclusions.

Routing: 1338 paths have no specialist capability match. They remain visible through `consult-reuse.ps1 -Concern donor-audit` and issue #3; lack of a keyword match is NOT an exclusion. Every CSV row includes capability routing and owning issue links.

Inventory: 1868 files; 39 complete source-file comparisons; 1829 pending comparisons; 21 compared files with known parity gaps. Header/implementation pairs can describe the same gap. Missing sparse files remain pending.

Every inventoried path, source revision/hash, target/proof file and line, omitted code, disposition and concrete reason is in `file-comparison.csv`. Hash-bound manual decisions are in `file-comparison-evidence.json`. Donor SHA-256 values bind original bytes; target/proof SHA-256 values bind UTF-8 without BOM with LF newlines. Anchors are recomputed into exact line numbers. Test-code presence is not test execution; execution receipts are in `FILE-COMPARISON-RECEIPTS.md`.

## Exact reviewed-file mappings and omission decisions

### ControllerBoardMini/Puzzles: `LocalLib/Keys.cpp`

Verdict: **parity-gap**. Revision: `filesystem-snapshot`. Original-byte SHA-256: `9ceb7e764ef9d4d5feb62b2c7a22eed59d614b7b56432fae87ce87b4aa434578`.

- Target: `firmware/avr/avr.ino:409 [UTF8-LF sha256=f6423ea162c567a1d418a5f8512cc0e4c8ccc1a940f6cf6e8b945a433783d016; anchor=void serviceInputs(]`.
- Target: `firmware/avr/avr.ino:394 [UTF8-LF sha256=f6423ea162c567a1d418a5f8512cc0e4c8ccc1a940f6cf6e8b945a433783d016; anchor=void boardKeyGesture(]`.
- Retained: Active-low physical plus virtual shift input state and candidate/stable transition tracking; AVR reports releases as dirty state; press handling is mode-specific.
- Retained: Actual PCController per-key callback/gesture classifier now feeds all nine inputs; no game action waits for click classification.
- Omitted/replaced code: `DEBOUNCE_MS = 50`. Disposition: **pending**. Reason: Actual PCController classifier now uses macro-configurable PAKAR_KEY_DEBOUNCE_MS (default 20ms) with tested Down/Up, click and hold timing. Physical switch-bounce measurements remain pending; faster is not certified electrically.
- Omitted/replaced code: `Key virtual readCurrentState/onStateChanged, setCallback, bool/getCurrentState interface`. Disposition: **replaced**. Reason: Imported PCController per-key classifier, setCallback and setEventCallback are retained. updateSample separates the input driver from gesture classification and supports all nine shift/ADC keys; subclass-specific raw reads are replaced by the actual board sample adapter.
- Omitted/replaced code: `Raw Puzzles lower-four input order`. Disposition: **pending**. Reason: Current PCController-based register reader reverses those bits. Physical key identity must decide the mapping; source reuse alone cannot.
- Remaining: Add input mapping/debounce configuration and bounce/press/release tests; preserve reusable callback capability or record a reviewed alternative contract.

### ControllerBoardMini/Puzzles: `LocalLib/Keys.h`

Verdict: **parity-gap**. Revision: `filesystem-snapshot`. Original-byte SHA-256: `caa21fe97e3df262f0821bd582b60f2895a14ec193d7d6fec13321afe4c5a46d`.

### ControllerBoardMini/Puzzles: `LocalLib/pitches.h`

Verdict: **equivalent-behavior**. Revision: `filesystem-snapshot`. Original-byte SHA-256: `0443f50675e84f826b7688dda6a1c822d666fe6413b055a8920cbacd83c12fc4`.

- Target: `firmware/avr/pitches.h:3 [UTF8-LF sha256=9ee408d89e25e5f99d0d56ff096b8ccb00f3737551599105f01ca8215018a23f; anchor=#define NOTE_B0]`.
- Retained: All donor NOTE_B0 through NOTE_DS8 and REST macro values retained; target adds only #pragma once.
- No production-code omission claimed for this reviewed file.
- Remaining: Other donor melody definitions still require individual inventory and integration; retaining pitches is not all-melody proof.

### ControllerBoardMini/Puzzles: `LocalLib/RotaryEncoder.cpp`

Verdict: **parity-gap**. Revision: `filesystem-snapshot`. Original-byte SHA-256: `86a2e78c3139b444db51157d2429968f3f33a7cd88c44658cda08a249351162d`.

- Retained: D2/D3 ownership is recorded in BoardPins, but no target rotary encoder implementation is claimed.
- Omitted/replaced code: `RotaryEncoder TWO03 object, setupRotaryEncoder and D3 CHANGE interrupt tick`. Disposition: **pending**. Reason: No encoder has been confirmed in the current hardware inventory. D2/D3 are also reserved for optional RC; silently enabling donor interrupts would create an ownership conflict. This is deferred, not approved permanent deletion.
- Omitted/replaced code: `Commented alternate RotaryEncoder constructor/attachInterrupt prototype`. Disposition: **not-applicable**. Reason: This block is commented out in the donor and never executes; active encoder behavior still remains an open hardware/feature decision.
- Remaining: Confirm fitted encoder/RC hardware and pin ownership; retain configurable encoder support where applicable.

- Retained: A4/SDA DIO and A5/SCL CLK pin ownership; segment-level output via current compact driver.
- Omitted/replaced code: `External TM1637Display wrapper and its complete external-library public API`. Disposition: **pending**. Reason: The compact driver replaces basic raw/text/number output but full external library parity, including leading-zero/dot/position APIs, has not been audited. Correct pins alone do not justify dropping those capabilities.
- Remaining: Review exact donor library revision/API and either add useful capabilities or justify each missing entry; close matching PCController recovery gap.

### ControllerBoardMini/Puzzles: `LocalLib/Tasks.cpp`

Verdict: **parity-gap**. Revision: `filesystem-snapshot`. Original-byte SHA-256: `3f5ef23f7a8052d8086b2803343e3e22bb9751924b7760077950f4b0bd2cc196`.

- Retained: Only cooperative target-specific timers exist in current AVR services; the generic donor task scheduler is not implemented.
- Omitted/replaced code: `Tasks::addTask/cancelTask/update and ten callback slots`. Disposition: **pending**. Reason: Front-panel deadlines do not replace arbitrary scheduled callbacks or cancellation. It is useful infrastructure and needs an explicit replacement, not a business-logic exclusion.
- Omitted/replaced code: `startsAt==0 free-slot sentinel and currentTime > startsAt comparison`. Disposition: **pending**. Reason: Do not copy the rollover/zero-deadline ambiguity unchanged. A replacement must keep the generic scheduling/cancellation API using explicit occupancy and wrap-safe deadlines; such a replacement is not present yet.
- Remaining: Implement and test a bounded cooperative scheduler: cancellation, full queue, zero delay, callback reentrancy and millis rollover.

- Retained: Ten queued tones/pauses and PB1/D9 buzzer ownership; note constants retained in pitches.h.
- Omitted/replaced code: `waitForTonesEnd blocking loop`. Disposition: **replaced**. Reason: Nonblocking update() plus isBusy() preserves completion observation while allowing UART, input and front-panel services to run; a busy wait would starve those required services.
- Omitted/replaced code: `Global addTone/resetTone/playToneSequence state/functions and millis()+duration deadline`. Disposition: **replaced**. Reason: Object-owned enqueue/stop/update retains queue lifecycle and avoids namespace/global ownership collisions; deadline anchoring and signed rollover comparisons replace accumulating loop delay.
- Omitted/replaced code: `Unbounded frequency and zero-duration acceptance`. Disposition: **replaced**. Reason: Requests outside the explicit hardware/wire range are rejected rather than accepted without reliable output.
- Test-code evidence: `tests/tone_player_test.cpp:20 [UTF8-LF sha256=69aba7426639bc88a60e8f6a51cef0ecfbed73c3d4a16ab453d4e1f2d50ae794; anchor=player.update(start+270)]`.

- Scoped advantage: Hardware compare toggling replaces the older donor software approach; nonblocking deadline anchoring passes late-call/rollover tests.
- Remaining: Register-double tests are not audible or physical clock proof.

- Retained: Actual FastLED WS2811 setup and TypicalLEDStrip correction concept; full 255 brightness; ESP owns the final strip engine.
- Omitted/replaced code: `AVR D6 / 11-pixel final effect buffer`. Disposition: **replaced**. Reason: User assigned final WS2811 effects to ESP D2 and 80 groups of six LEDs. A duplicate 480-pixel AVR buffer would consume 1440 bytes before protocol/game state on a 2 KiB AVR; streaming it over UART would also consume bandwidth. D6 remains a diagnostic pin, not a second full engine.
- Omitted/replaced code: `COLOR_ORDER BRG`. Disposition: **pending**. Reason: Current ESP code hardcodes RGB. Different chip/wiring orders are not inherently better; independent R/G/B physical tests and a configurable order are required before declaring channel parity.
- Omitted/replaced code: `Black initialization and second post-show loop clearing leds[]`. Disposition: **replaced**. Reason: Pakar initializes logical cells white to match the explicitly requested table mode, instead of the donor eleven-LED black scene. No claim of generic performance superiority is made for removing this loop.
- Remaining: Make chipset/channel order configurable and verify R/G/B plus all 480 pixels on hardware; expose current configuration across the control surfaces.

- Retained: Actual donor ACK sampling, one-second cached-frame/brightness keepalive, observed presence and active 70ms brightness service on PC4/PC5. Independent probing was removed.
- Omitted/replaced code: `PB3/PB5 TM1637 bus pins`. Disposition: **replaced**. Reason: User-confirmed PuzzleBoard owns A4/SDA as DIO and A5/SCL as CLK. D11/D13 must remain free for ESP-driven ISP; copying PCController's pins would conflict with programming.
- Test-code evidence: `tests/pc_contract_test.cpp:266 [UTF8-LF sha256=562145677bbcee14307aeeaed2a720f6138cc9ca156a1f5423b6696d97a7aff8; anchor=void keysAndDisplay()]`.

- Scoped advantage: Retains donor recovery on the correct board pins, accumulates intermediate NACKs instead of letting the final control ACK hide failure; host disconnect/reconnect and true-off tests pass.
- Remaining: Physical TM1637 unplug/replug and power-cycle acceptance remains unverified; host GPIO doubles are not a physical board.

- Scoped advantage: Retains donor recovery on the correct board pins, accumulates intermediate NACKs instead of letting the final control ACK hide failure; host disconnect/reconnect and true-off tests pass.
- Remaining: Physical TM1637 unplug/replug and power-cycle acceptance remains unverified; host GPIO doubles are not a physical board.

- Retained: Timer1 OC1A PB1/D9 hardware output without audio ISR; ten-step nonblocking ring queue; silent pauses; begin/stop/mute and active telemetry.
- Retained: PCController already uses Timer1 hardware toggling; that is reuse, not a Pakar invention.
- Omitted/replaced code: `now + step.durationMs; nondelegating default constructor; stale idle active-frequency metadata`. Disposition: **replaced**. Reason: Pakar delegates construction, anchors the next step to the previous deadline, skips fully expired steps, and zeros idle metadata. Register-double tests exercise late calls, wraparound and idle state.
- Omitted/replaced code: `Permissive enqueue of unsupported frequency/zero-duration requests`. Disposition: **replaced**. Reason: Rejecting zero durations and nonzero frequencies outside 20..20000 Hz matches the bounded wire contract and avoids silently scheduling an unplayable request.

- Retained: Actual canonical-cache/stable-staging/preservation/blocked-operation and separate runtime-acceptance guidance read and adopted in mandatory continuation policy and tooling.
- Omitted/replaced code: `Historical Pealayer paths, exact relocation/cleanup/deployment/media-clock events`. Disposition: **not-applicable**. Reason: These are donor historical facts, not Pakar installations. Copying them would misrepresent ownership or completed cleanup.
- Omitted/replaced code: `Same-volume rename/hardlink-aware relocation and reusable host profile/peer updater workflow`. Disposition: **pending**. Reason: These are useful generic mechanisms but no Pakar cache relocation or complete updater deployment is implemented by this policy. Current blocked cleanup stays blocked; no rerouting through another shell.
- Omitted/replaced code: `Mandatory donor lookup was previously absent from executable build/stage/capture paths`. Disposition: **replaced**. Reason: Capability lookup with source/target/test hash gates now runs before those actions; other task surfaces are required by AGENTS.md, not falsely claimed universally sandbox-enforced.
- Remaining: Complete applicable generic host/relocation/updater tooling after ownership checks; extend executable gates when additional capability mappings are fully reviewed.

- Retained: Actual donor PrintWindow P/Invoke, minimized/window-bounds validation, DPI awareness, System.Drawing PNG lifecycle and read-only behavior.
- Omitted/replaced code: `Get-Process -Name foreground filter`. Disposition: **replaced**. Reason: Explicit expected PID and window-owner revalidation remove ambiguity between production and fixtures; screen fallback checks foreground ownership without changing focus.
- Omitted/replaced code: `RenderOccludedWindow branching and unconditional Bitmap.Save`. Disposition: **replaced**. Reason: Capability-gated egui framebuffer is tried first, then PrintWindow/BitBlt and verified foreground pixels. Blank images and overwrites are rejected.
- Test-code evidence: `tests/screenshot_harness_test.mjs:9 [UTF8-LF sha256=b1378631676b871090abb8c83457b4c5c2a1c5dfbfaed7a662045cae2919bb9f; anchor=for(const forbidden]`.
- Scoped advantage: PID-bound, no-overwrite capture with an app-owned framebuffer and automatic read-only Win32 fallback; runtime evidence is separate from source guards.

- Retained: Actual donor module extraction/intersection, thin executable and MSVC duplicate resource linkage guards imported/adapted. Native build wrapper and CI execute this read-only guard before compiling.
- Omitted/replaced code: `pealayer::startup::run and main.rs/lib.rs module intersection assertions`. Disposition: **replaced**. Reason: Pakar has one binary today. The adapted tool detects optional lib.rs and then enforces zero executable modules, module ownership and delegation to Pakar's library namespace. Today's single binary additionally rejects duplicate declarations without requiring a nonexistent Pealayer startup symbol.
- Omitted/replaced code: `MSVC winres library/bin duplicate resource.lib guard`. Disposition: **replaced**. Reason: Both original resource.lib patterns are retained and run for today's binary as well as a future shared-library layout. No need to defer these guards until the architecture changes.
- Test-code evidence: `tests/crate_boundary_test.mjs:4 [UTF8-LF sha256=ebf1cbc5410a3f67a7b704d17415801e68daeba961253f8b60a183fdb5fec17f; anchor=const single =]`.
- Scoped advantage: Executes useful donor guards immediately on the current single-binary layout, rejects duplicate declarations, and automatically activates library ownership/thin-entry checks when a library appears. No compiler or generated fixture writes.

- Retained: Actual Get-PealayerWindowsHostPaths, Get-PealayerCargoTargetDirectory and Get-PealayerFileIdentity adapted to Pakar names/locations. Environment expansion and relative overrides retained; native build and staging now call these helpers.
- Omitted/replaced code: `Resolve-PealayerLibmpv, Copy-PealayerLibmpvRuntime and Set-PealayerLibmpvBuildEnvironment`. Disposition: **not-applicable**. Reason: Pakar is explicitly mpv-free; importing DLL aliases, GNU/MSVC mpv imports, LIBMPV_DIR and native linker flags would restore an excluded media dependency.
- Omitted/replaced code: `Save-PealayerWindowsHostProfile generic host provenance and generated Cargo-config ownership protection`. Disposition: **pending**. Reason: Saved host/compiler/cache provenance and refusal to overwrite user-managed configuration remain useful. Pakar currently resolves its established cache/explicit override but does not persist this generic host profile.
- Omitted/replaced code: `Program-root shared target default across separate source worktrees`. Disposition: **pending**. Reason: Pakar keeps its existing single canonical desktop/target cache without moving or duplicating it. A future managed-worktree build needs a shared Pakar-owned cache; copying Pealayer's owner path would corrupt ownership.
- Test-code evidence: `tests/reuse_preflight_test.ps1:72 [UTF8-LF sha256=a12ead0e223a41f5a4db2bf64a430c69e2518061ef3184a51fd71cfb9c3366f1; anchor=Actual donor relative cache resolution]`.

- Retained: Byte-identical actual donor process-handle probe: no-shell hidden process, async redirected stdout, 30-second wait, explicit exit code, output return and Dispose. Optional staging probe calls this helper.
- No production-code omission claimed for this reviewed file.

- Retained: Actual Assert-PackageSourceStable adapted without Web exclusions; optional ExpectedCommit checks run before/after build/stage. Imported bounded Process probe and file-identity helper are used by staging; identical hashes skip payload copies.
- Omitted/replaced code: `libmpv runtime/import-library packaging and pealayer-downloader media companion`. Disposition: **not-applicable**. Reason: The user explicitly requested an mpv-free controller, not the donor media player/downloader. Board remote firmware contracts remain required separately.
- Omitted/replaced code: `Restore-PackageWebDistribution git restore and recursive generated-Web cleanup`. Disposition: **replaced**. Reason: Pakar staging does not generate or mutate a tracked Web distribution. Blind donor restoration could overwrite user work and is not copied.
- Omitted/replaced code: `Branding, Persian font/Web bundle packaging, Win32 resource and quick-action icon verification, UPX validation`. Disposition: **pending**. Reason: These are useful generic package capabilities. Existing app source contains icons/font but current staging does not validate/package all donor facilities.
- Omitted/replaced code: `Embedded --build-info/--smoke-test checks, GITHUB_SHA invalidation and host-manifest artifact/provenance/validation schema`. Disposition: **pending**. Reason: Current app lacks equivalent embedded source identity and full runtime smoke. Optional Git source-stability and CLI-help checks are narrower and cannot certify the old executable's source commit.
- Omitted/replaced code: `Unconditional repeated executable/DLL/output copies`. Disposition: **replaced**. Reason: One stable candidate and source/destination checksum equality skip identical writes; no mpv payload exists.
- Omitted/replaced code: `Timestamp package metadata and native optional Run`. Disposition: **pending**. Reason: User excludes dated/random project/package names, not necessarily diagnostic time fields. Preserve useful manifest provenance and bounded explicit launching in a future adapted package pipeline.
- Remaining: Import full mpv-free package manifest, embedded identity, resource/icon/font/Web validation and appropriate generic runner; do not call staging a full package release.

- Retained: Shared resolver call and locked native build flow mapped to Pakar wrapper. Existing canonical cache is reused; explicit Check/Test/Release and storage/reuse gates avoid unnecessary links.
- Omitted/replaced code: `RustBin machine/user/toolchain executable fallback selection and rustc -vV host detection`. Disposition: **pending**. Reason: Pakar currently uses installed Cargo from PATH. Alternate host/toolchain executable fallback and recorded host triple are reusable infrastructure and remain unported.
- Omitted/replaced code: `libmpv host resolution/environment/profile and DLL copy`. Disposition: **not-applicable**. Reason: These operations configure the excluded mpv renderer. Pakar uses its own mpv-free linked dependencies.
- Omitted/replaced code: `BuildOnly versus launch forwarding with ApplicationArguments`. Disposition: **pending**. Reason: Pakar wrapper builds only. Generic built-executable validation and configurable run forwarding should become a Pakar runner; manual launching is not equivalent.
- Omitted/replaced code: `Set-Location to repository root`. Disposition: **replaced**. Reason: Absolute manifest and resolved target paths preserve caller cwd without introducing a second cache.
- Test-code evidence: `tests/build_storage_test.ps1:15 [UTF8-LF sha256=ac9af1dddae9cf93afdf7dad889c73e1b4f11e4efcce254d0b621b5218dd47aa; anchor=One canonical target]`.

- Retained: Actual PrintWindow(PW_RENDERFULLCONTENT), near-uniform-black sampler, GetWindowDC/BitBlt/screen fallback and PID/dimension validation imported. Pakar fixture supplies isolated profile/selected surfaces; app-owned framebuffer capture does not depend on WGC.
- Omitted/replaced code: `SetForegroundWindow, BringWindowToTop, SetWindowPos, ShowWindow, SetCursorPos, mouse_event, SendMouseWheel/Click/RightClick`. Disposition: **replaced**. Reason: Capture remains read-only and must not steal focus, resize or inject desktop input. Startup CLI sets the application's own surface; native gestures belong to the supported computer-use APIs.
- Omitted/replaced code: `DwmGetWindowAttribute extended bounds and logical/client coordinate transformations`. Disposition: **replaced**. Reason: Per-monitor-v2 physical GetWindowRect is kept consistent with full window-DC capture, avoiding a mismatched crop origin. Internal framebuffer needs no desktop coordinates.
- Omitted/replaced code: `Locale/Theme arrays, PreferencesTab/Icon, AppName/Branding, WorkspaceDockLayout and per-surface matrix manifest`. Disposition: **pending**. Reason: Config-driven Pakar CLI surfaces/isolated profiles exist, but the full multi-locale/theme/icon/width matrix and hashed per-capture manifest runner remain useful unported harness work.
- Omitted/replaced code: `temporary GUID profile cleanup, process CloseMainWindow/Kill and generated_at_utc`. Disposition: **replaced**. Reason: Stable named evidence/profiles are retained for debugging rather than deleted. Only verified fixture processes are stopped; production replacement uses graceful typed IPC and avoids timestamp/suffix deliverables.
- Omitted/replaced code: `native resize/scroll/client-coordinate scenario parameters`. Disposition: **pending**. Reason: Model/painter tests and selected-surface captures do not replace the full interactive narrow/wide scenario matrix. Native live gesture acceptance remains separate.
- Test-code evidence: `tests/screenshot_harness_test.mjs:9 [UTF8-LF sha256=b1378631676b871090abb8c83457b4c5c2a1c5dfbfaed7a662045cae2919bb9f; anchor=for(const forbidden]`.

- Retained: Default Preferences Ctrl+, and device configuration Ctrl+Shift+, navigation exist; F11 fullscreen is restored with the shared typed dispatcher. These are not equivalent to the donor persisted rebinding model.
- Omitted/replaced code: `ApplicationShortcuts persisted fields, parse_shortcut, entries, validate, action_for_event and their non-media tests`. Disposition: **pending**. Reason: The foundation hardcoded its accelerators and omitted the reusable binding model. No accepted reason justifies leaving rebinding out. The actual donor depends on KeyChord and hardware_shortcuts match/key-code helpers, which must be ported and tested with controller-specific typed actions rather than guessed labels.
- Omitted/replaced code: `take_frame_step_shortcut and frame-step tests`. Disposition: **not-applicable**. Reason: These consume Ctrl+Left/Right for media frame stepping and timeline transport. Those business domains were explicitly removed; Pakar must not hijack ordinary text word navigation for nonexistent video frames.
- Omitted/replaced code: `containing_media_folder and local-media path tests`. Disposition: **not-applicable**. Reason: This resolves media files/streams, not board identities or firmware files. Firmware selection already uses explicit native file dialogs; introducing a nonexistent media folder action would be misleading.
- Omitted/replaced code: `media_information and media_folder accelerators`. Disposition: **pending**. Reason: The media operations cannot be retained as-is, but their reusable information/folder-navigation affordances need explicit hardware-monitor and application-folder action decisions. They are not silently treated as completed controller mappings.
- Remaining: Restore validated persistent rebinding, exact-modifier matching, repeat/release rejection and text-edit protection; separately reconcile global/hardware shortcut ownership.

- Retained: Actual typed action/resource catalog, equality traits, explicit negative resource-index selection, Preferences, Exit and generic Toggle fullscreen. Controller actions share the launch/IPC dispatcher and resource compiler.
- Omitted/replaced code: `Play / Pause, Previous chapter, Next chapter, Mute / Unmute media quick actions`. Disposition: **not-applicable**. Reason: Pakar intentionally has no mpv playback, chapters or media volume. These would call removed media business methods. Connect, device settings, refresh, workspaces and About are real controller navigation actions instead; generic fullscreen is retained, not misclassified as media-only.
- Test-code evidence: `desktop/src/platform/windows_quick_actions.rs:69 [UTF8-LF sha256=cefe74617d723f5dd9ef987613cbcfd593e196f7a0bbfd704d65b0759034f2cd; anchor=fn controller_shell_actions_have_unique_native_resource_ids]`.
- Remaining: Visible Windows Jump List clicks remain a manual acceptance gate; typed launch forwarding and resource uniqueness are tested.

- Retained: Byte-identical actual Phosphor rasterizer, centered glyph coverage, all seven ICO resolutions, bottom-up BGRA, DWORD-aligned AND masks and explicit directory offsets. Pakar build.rs uses it for PE, tray and action assets.
- No production-code omission claimed for this reviewed file.
- Remaining: User-configurable icon packs and runtime state-icon transitions are a separate unresolved integration; retaining the generator does not implement that editor.

- Retained: Production Phosphor vocabulary, stable names/kind fallback, searchable list/grid picker, UTF-8-safe match highlighting, bounded popups, disclosure/submenu helpers.
- Retained: Actual donor regression tests restored: eleven tests, including interactive egui-frame search/select/reopen, both themes and popup width.
- Omitted/replaced code: `every_native_icon_editor_uses_the_shared_searchable_picker donor-only editor path list`. Disposition: **replaced**. Reason: That assertion references Pealayer media/4D editor files not present in this product. Replaced only its call-site assertion with Pakar's actual workspace editor; the other ten tests were imported. This does not excuse missing generic editor features elsewhere.
- Test-code evidence: `desktop/src/ui/icons.rs:825 [UTF8-LF sha256=b3d882b8832f0c74c579ddfba1a992723b4ed06a8521e1a0aa1d2d45128e6a11; anchor=fn pakar_workspace_editor_uses_the_actual_shared_searchable_picker()]`.

- Retained: Native semantic visual-role mapping and actual palette JSON; appearance geometry is not overwritten.
- Omitted/replaced code: `WebAppearanceState and donor native/Web shared-preferences assertions`. Disposition: **pending**. Reason: Pakar lacks the shared native/Web preferences contract. These are useful generic requirements, not media business logic; omitting them cannot be justified as superior.
- Omitted/replaced code: `Donor default Native palette`. Disposition: **replaced**. Reason: Pakar chooses Studio as its product default. Both palettes remain available; this is a preference decision, not a measured improvement.
- Test-code evidence: `desktop/src/ui/palette.rs:101 [UTF8-LF sha256=27e4d4ab36060699693c2bdd951c46666b1831fc9d0a1771b6980b431076cd3e; anchor=fn donor_surface_text_roles_and_geometry_are_preserved_in_both_themes()]`.

- Retained: Actual donor root-only overlay: four newest messages, severity icons and semantic palette roles, bounded width, scrollable text, title, dismiss and deadline-driven repaint.
- Omitted/replaced code: `interop::get_live_config() accessor`. Disposition: **replaced**. Reason: Pakar owns the same live palette through config::live(). The OS-native notification route is separate; adding an explicit in-app enable preference does not remove the donor overlay when enabled.
- Remaining: This native overlay mapping is not shared Web/TUI message-delivery parity.

### Pealayer: `tests/windows_shell_suite_test.rs`

Verdict: **parity-gap**. Revision: `a54933aa7d0c05a058045dc9cd21b1b7fbc7378e`. Original-byte SHA-256: `d8696d8b591ca8ae4c77c78a07d19f6aca103e29906f267f19ac8ba1aa5d6e01`.

- Retained: Actual Preferences action/resource catalog is validated; invalid HWND registration rejects rather than claiming success; owner exclusion is tested. Live notification acceptance and shown-callback evidence are recorded independently.
- Omitted/replaced code: `Playback-duration error/paused percentages and Play/Pause thumbnail/tray labels`. Disposition: **not-applicable**. Reason: The tests model removed video playback, not device transfer progress. Pakar uses indeterminate taskbar activity only for a real pending settings/maintenance request; inventing a media percentage would publish false progress.
- Omitted/replaced code: `PealayerApp::default and media playback_time/duration/is_paused assignments`. Disposition: **replaced**. Reason: Pakar is an executable-only mpv-free controller; creating the donor media engine is inappropriate. Actual controller IPC/live smoke and direct invalid-HWND tests exercise its own lifetime instead.
- Omitted/replaced code: `ensure_shell_initialized retry and repeated shell-lifecycle acceptance`. Disposition: **pending**. Reason: Tray creation failures are visible and close-to-tray cannot hide an app without a tray, but complete root-taskbar initialization/retry and Explorer restart acceptance are not covered by the current tests.
- Test-code evidence: `desktop/src/platform/windows_notifications.rs:110 [UTF8-LF sha256=4603df421e6361701f4d092e0f966abdd39a0fb91f968a098fd5552b67c6c00a; anchor=fn utf16_limits_preserve_complete_surrogates_and_termination]`.

- Retained: Actual insertion/shift/backspace/delete, CSI/SS3 arrows/home/end, Ctrl-C/Ctrl-L and split CR-LF/CR-NUL handling retained.
- Retained: Password input is not echoed and is scrubbed; overflow discards the entire line instead of executing a truncated command; editor state is independent.
- Omitted/replaced code: `ShellTransport_Serial, SerialShellSession and serial-shell service`. Disposition: **pending**. Reason: USB currently owns COBS-framed PC commands. Mixing raw shell bytes would corrupt that transport; provide an explicit framed shell channel or negotiated mode before claiming equivalent serial-shell support.
- Omitted/replaced code: `DeviceParameters get/set registry, readonly behavior and commandMap callbacks`. Disposition: **pending**. Reason: Pakar's fixed game/identity/display commands are not equivalent to the useful generic parameter registry. Audit/adapt the generic registry and supply Pakar parameter descriptors; only actual PU application callbacks may be excluded after individual review.
- Omitted/replaced code: `ShellBroadcastLine, event-line prompt erasure/redraw and active-session output routing`. Disposition: **pending**. Reason: Pakar redraws during editing but does not implement the donor's asynchronous event-broadcast/session routing contract; a WebSocket event feed is not a Telnet prompt-safe replacement.
- Omitted/replaced code: `clear/cls, echo, hex, upper/noupper and reusable formatting helpers`. Disposition: **pending**. Reason: The current command set omits these donor shell utilities. No concrete product or hardware reason justifies blanket deletion; implement applicable utilities or provide reviewed alternatives.
- Omitted/replaced code: `NumberFromString unchecked multiply/add and permissive embedded minus/comma parsing`. Disposition: **pending**. Reason: Do not copy signed-overflow-prone numeric parsing unchanged. The current String::toInt call sites still require a bounded strict parser plus overflow tests; avoiding this donor function alone is not a proven superior replacement.
- Omitted/replaced code: `Mutable global command pointer and include Commands.cpp adapter`. Disposition: **replaced**. Reason: Instance-owned line/editor state and explicit command dispatch avoid the legacy global pointer/include ownership pattern. Useful command behavior itself remains pending rather than excluded with the adapter.
- Test-code evidence: `tests/telnet_shell_test.cpp:45 [UTF8-LF sha256=f7dd91333d3aced80fdab41b146b98ecd2e9dd3896a504f8a70cfb33912f00e9; anchor=LineEditor::TooLong]`.
- Remaining: Port generic registry and useful utilities; implement prompt-safe asynchronous events; keep serial framing explicit.
- Remaining: Harden command JSON construction/numeric arguments and report queued versus AVR-acknowledged outcomes; current immediate OK is not proof of AVR execution.

## Unreviewed files are not approved omissions

Every pending path has its own CSV row. Its omission reason explicitly says there is no approved reason to leave it out. Prior keyword screening or an unbound historical adaptation note is not accepted as behavior proof. This includes all still-pending PuzzleBoard/40LED variants and ControllerBoardMini legacy files, plus unreviewed Pealayer/PCController/PU850 files, assets, dependencies, tests and scripts. Earlier focused variant notes remain useful routing evidence, not complete comparative certification.

File-by-file checklist: https://github.com/atomicdeploy/PakarController/issues/3. Master production acceptance: https://github.com/atomicdeploy/PakarController/issues/2. Run `pwsh -File tools/generate-file-comparison.ps1 -RequireComplete` to enforce the comparison gate. It must fail while any pending comparison or known source parity gap remains. Physical, deployment, visual and all-surface acceptance are separate gates even after this one passes.
