## Overview

An ESP32-S3 / ESP8266 + ATmega328P controller with an mpv-free Windows workspace, embedded
Web interface, CLI/TUI and an Android preview. Controls must follow the connected
board's acknowledged capabilities; offline or unsupported peripherals are not
invented by the client. Pealayer supplies real reusable desktop foundations,
PCController supplies protocol/contracts, and the earlier boards supply hardware
mapping and reusable drivers. Exact reuse gaps remain tracked rather than hidden.

## Access and recovery

### Peer identity and supported releases

The coordinated source release is **0.2.8** (client build **15**). Apps and
firmware enforce the shared minimum supported release by default, independently
disableable at build time. HTTP headers, discovery and `/api/peer/info` identify
each party; `/api/clients` exposes bounded, nonsecret peer introductions. API
paths remain unversioned, with additive capabilities rather than build-specific
adapters. Older installed products need a coordinated update; this source/build
checkpoint is not a deployment. See [policy, build flags and recovery](docs/PEER-IDENTITY.md).

### Share a selected connection

Native **Preferences → Connection → Share connection** can publish the selected
USB or network board through the existing HTTP/WebSocket table APIs, with opt-in
mDNS/DNS-SD, SSDP and MNDP discovery. USB remains offline unless sharing is
enabled. Other clients use `http://<configured-hostname>.local:8789`; downstream
board identity and sole serial ownership are preserved. See the
[bridge contract and remaining scope](docs/API.md#application-api-bridge--repeater).
Opaque firmware transfer, binary streaming and full PCController peer-RPC parity
are not yet exposed by this bridge; real LAN acceptance remains open in issue #2.

### Device access

Authentication defaults off in the current firmware; older installations can
retain persisted credentials. Inspect **Device access** or use the explicit USB
recovery utility rather than guessing a factory password.
See [Access and recovery](https://github.com/atomicdeploy/PakarController/blob/feature/pealayer-desktop-foundation/docs/ACCESS.md) and the explicit
[PU850 parity audit](https://github.com/atomicdeploy/PakarController/blob/feature/pealayer-desktop-foundation/docs/PU850-PARITY.md). ESPAsyncWebServer now hosts the
Web UI/API/WebSocket, ESP OTA and AVR ISP in the same firmware.

Version 0.2.7 adds [pinned remote two-board updates and full operational telemetry](https://github.com/atomicdeploy/PakarController/blob/feature/pealayer-desktop-foundation/docs/REMOTE-MAINTENANCE.md).
The [50-route PU850 mapping](https://github.com/atomicdeploy/PakarController/blob/feature/pealayer-desktop-foundation/docs/PU850-ROUTE-PARITY.md) records exact adaptations and exclusions.
Physical and publisher acceptance remain open in [issue #7](https://github.com/atomicdeploy/PakarController/issues/7); no production deployment is implied by a passing build.

PakarController is a two-controller game platform built from the reusable parts of
AtomicDeploy's earlier PuzzleBoard, 40LED, Puzzles, pu850-esp, PCController,
and Pealayer work.

- The ATmega328P owns deterministic keys, shift-register outputs, the ninth
  ADC6 button, TM1637 display, buzzer, melodies, and winner arbitration.
- The ESP32-S3 owns the MT16703/WS2811-compatible LED field, Wi-Fi/API/UI,
  streaming, self-OTA, AVR ISP recovery, and LittleFS firmware backups.
- The retained ESP8266 target shares the integrated firmware; Bluetooth is S3-only.
- Both use the PCController COBS + CRC-8/ATM UART envelope at 38400 baud. The
  AVR uses its hardware UART; S3 uses a separate hardware UART (ESP8266 uses
  SoftwareSerial), while the USB UART
  is a second framed 115200-baud PC transport.
- The Windows controller uses Pealayer's eframe/egui design approach without
  linking or loading mpv.
- Optional outbound cloud links provide TLS MQTT telemetry/commands and a
  configurable WebSocket client. MQTT and WebSocket secrets are write-only and
  stored in checksum-backed LittleFS configuration.
- The PU850-derived network toolbox also includes mDNS discovery and a
  password-authenticated Telnet command shell without taking over either UART.

No I2C peripheral is enabled or required.

See `docs/HARDWARE.md`, `docs/HARDWARE-VERIFICATION.md`,
`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/API.md`, `docs/TOOLCHAIN.md`, and
`docs/LEGACY-CODE-AUDIT.md` before wiring or flashing.

The native Windows app is in `desktop/`. It deliberately has no mpv or
`libmpv2` dependency. Its eframe, reqwest, serde versions and system-aware
visual styling are derived from Pealayer's MIT-licensed desktop foundation.
It can stream a generated rainbow or sample the primary screen into the 10 by
8 staggered table through the authenticated WebSocket.
The Streaming panel exposes a shared target rate (60 FPS by default; 0 is
uncapped) and measured completed host frame writes. This is not measured LED
refresh. Monitor/region selection and live frame-rate acceptance remain open.

## Build

Use the current main checkout and existing SDK installations:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/atomicdeploy/PakarController.git
cd PakarController
.\pakar.cmd doctor
.\pakar.cmd all                         # plan only, no SDK compilation
```

Windows and Bash entrypoints share one dispatcher, staged output, validated
arguments and guarded build wrappers. Node 20.19+ and PowerShell 7 are required.
The central [firmware pins](tools/firmware-dependencies.json) are unchanged by
builds; installation and dependency updates are explicit:

```powershell
.\pakar.cmd dependencies --plan
.\pakar.cmd firmware --target esp32s3 --plan
.\pakar.cmd firmware --target esp32s3 --link-mode buffered --s3-flash-mb 16 --s3-psram opi
.\pakar.cmd desktop --mode Check --plan
.\pakar.cmd mobile --mode ApkPreview --build-only --plan
```

Linux/macOS use `bash pakar.sh` with the same options. Legacy `build.cmd` and
`bash build.sh polling` / `bash build.sh busy-wire` remain aliases; tests are
explicit rather than hidden build side effects. CI builds polling/busy-wire
ESP8266+AVR pairs and buffered S3+AVR; deployed peers need compatible build
flags. Every merged AVR+Urboot image must be exactly 32 KiB.

Run `.\pakar.cmd test protocol` for COBS/CRC bounds/corruption fixtures.
The [script tooling reference](docs/SCRIPT-TOOLING.md) covers common help,
JSON/quiet output, proxy support, dependency maintenance, artifact checksums,
automatic update plans, platform limits and exact PU850 source imports.

Build the Windows application with:

```powershell
.\tools\build-desktop.ps1                 # Check, no executable link
.\tools\build-desktop.ps1 -Mode Test      # Changed native behavior
.\tools\build-desktop.ps1 -Mode Release   # Only when an app update is needed
```

Build storage policy: [docs/BUILD-STORAGE.md](https://github.com/atomicdeploy/PakarController/blob/feature/pealayer-desktop-foundation/docs/BUILD-STORAGE.md). Native
debug/test symbols are disabled by default, with incremental reuse retained.
Build scripts refuse low free space or an oversized canonical Cargo cache.
Firmware compilation is incremental; use `-Target avr` or `-Target esp8266` for
an isolated board change and `-Clean` only when diagnosing a stale cache.
Linux supports `bash build.sh busy-wire esp8266` (optional `--clean`).
Use one stable staging directory and `tools/stage-desktop.ps1`; identical builds
skip copying. Fixtures can run directly from the canonical built executable.

Before any task or tool failure, follow [donor-first preflight](https://github.com/atomicdeploy/PakarController/blob/feature/pealayer-desktop-foundation/docs/REUSE-PREFLIGHT.md):
`./tools/consult-reuse.ps1 -Concern build-storage` (or capture, ui-shell, preferences,
windows-desktop, network-cloud, firmware-hardware, updates-telemetry, games-streaming).
Read actual matched donor code before a replacement or unsupported claim. Build,
stage and capture wrappers enforce hash-bound reviewed-slice gates automatically;
pending mappings remain visible and are not accepted exclusions.

The same executable provides scriptable CLI and interactive TUI surfaces. Set
`PAKAR_ENDPOINT`, and optionally `PAKAR_USER` / `PAKAR_PASSWORD`, then use:

```powershell
PakarController.exe --status
PakarController.exe --command cell 17 red fade
PakarController.exe --command mode snake
PakarController.exe --tui
```

Logical IDs are row-major: 1 is upper-left, 2 is next to it, and 11 begins the
second row. Graphical tables offset one-based odd columns by half a cell in Y;
each cell contains six LEDs. Physical strip order is a separate editable map.
The interactive terminal now has contextual pages, shared Find/selection,
explicit bulk white/red/off actions and the shared CLI command palette.
See [terminal controls and remaining acceptance](docs/TERMINAL-UI.md).
Staggered graphics, richer editors and full TUI parity remain open in issue #2.

## Continuous integration & delivery

The [CI/CD pipeline](.github/workflows/build.yml) checks generated interface,
branding and donor-evidence contracts, tests both UART build variants, builds
the Windows client and analyzes/tests/builds the Android preview. It stops at
the first failed command. Timeouts, superseded-run cancellation and short artifact
retention bound wasted work. The tooling matrix checks shared CLI fixtures and
guarded command plans on Windows/Linux/macOS; these are not native package or
hardware acceptance. [CodeQL](.github/workflows/codeql.yml) scans Actions
and JavaScript; it does not claim Rust, AVR C++ or physical hardware coverage.

The expanded pipeline supports version tags and explicit owner dispatch for **draft prereleases**, with
Windows and two-board firmware packages, Android preview, SHA-256 checksums,
source/run manifest and provenance attestation. No automatic flash occurs and
no development artifact is silently promoted to a production release.
PU-derived dependency checking and exact-artifact device deployment have separate
guarded workflows. Deployment is disabled until the owner explicitly configures
its runner/environment/opt-in. See [shared tooling and activation](docs/SCRIPT-TOOLING.md)
and [repository governance](docs/REPOSITORY-GOVERNANCE.md). Source configuration
does not certify that a current GitHub run passed or a device was updated.
